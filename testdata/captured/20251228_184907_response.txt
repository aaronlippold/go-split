Looking at this file, here's my recommended split:

## Recommended Split

### 1. **`unmarshal.go`**
**Contains:**
- `unmarshalOrFail`
- `unmarshalOrWarn`
- `unmarshalOrIgnore`

**Why:** These are generic JSON unmarshaling utilities with different error-handling strategies. They're cohesive helpers for response processing.

### 2. **`resolve.go`**
**Contains:**
- `resolveSingleID`
- `resolveManyIDs`
- `resolveManyIDsSkipFailures`

**Why:** These are all ID resolution operations. They build on each other (single → many → many with skip) and have a clear single responsibility.

## Why This Split Makes Sense

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Unmarshaling logic is distinct from ID resolution logic
2. **Discoverability**: Developers looking for unmarshal helpers won't wade through ID resolution code
3. **Testability**: Each file can have focused unit tests
4. **Clear Boundaries**: 
   - `unmarshal.go` = generic data transformation
   - `resolve.go` = domain-specific ID operations (uses RPC handler)
5. **Future Growth**: ID resolution might expand with caching, validation, etc. Unmarshaling is likely stable.

Both files should keep `package main` and the current imports (adjust as needed).
